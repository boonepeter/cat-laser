# Raspberry Pi Cat Laser Driver
# This code controls the laser pointer servos to target the laser at different
# locations.  Make sure to modify the MQTT_SERVER variable below so that it points
# to the name or IP address of the host computer for the cloud server VM (i.e. the
# machine running the Vagrant virtual machine that has the MQTT broker).
